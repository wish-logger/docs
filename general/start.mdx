</Card>

  - Manage Messages
  - View Channel
  - Send Messages
  - Manage Webhooks
  - Embed Links

<Tip>
  **Tip:** Make sure you have "Manage Server" or "Administrator" permissions on the Discord server you want to add Wish Logger to.
</Tip>

## Step 2: Access the Dashboard

Once Wish Logger is in your server, set up logging channels through our web dashboard:

<Card title="Open Dashboard" icon="book-open" color="#00d9ff" horizontal href="https://wishlogger.xyz/dashboard">
  Configure Wish Logger from your browser
</Card>

1. **Visit the dashboard** at [wishlogger.xyz/dashboard](https://wishlogger.xyz/dashboard)
2. **Login with Discord** — Click "Login with Discord" and authorize the dashboard
3. **Select your server** from the list of available servers

## Step 3: Configure Logging Channels

Choose where you want your logs to appear:

### ~~Option A: Automatic Setup~~

1. **~~Click "Auto Setup"~~** ~~in the dashboard~~
2. **~~Let Wish Logger create channels~~** ~~— We'll automatically create organized logging channels:~~
   - `#mod-action-logs`
   - `#member-logs`
   - `#messages-logs` 
   - `#voice-logs`
   - `#actions-logs`
   - `#server-logs` 
   - `#roles-logs` 
   - `#channel-logs`
3. **~~Review and confirm~~** ~~the channel setup~~

### Option B: Manual Setup (Recommended)

1. **Create your own channels** in Discord (or use existing ones)
2. **In the dashboard**, assign each log type to your preferred channels:
   1. **Mod Actions Logs** → Choose channel for moderator actions like mutes or kicks
   2. **Member Logs** → Choose channel for joins/leaves/role changes
   3. **Messages Logs** → Choose channel for message activity
   4. **Voice Logs** → Choose channel for voice changes
   5. **Actions Logs** → Choose channel for various server action events
   6. **Server Logs** → Choose channel for server-level changes and updates
   7. **Role Logs** → Choose channel for role actions
   8. **Channel Logs** → Choose channel for channel actions

...or select **Main Channel Log** to setup one channel for all types

3. **Save your settings**

<Warning>
  **Important:** Make sure Wish Logger has permission to send messages in your chosen logging channels.
</Warning>

## Step 4: Test Your Setup

Verify everything is working correctly:

1. **Edit or delete a message** in any channel
2. **Check your message logs channel** — You should see the logged event
3. **Try other actions** like joining a voice channel or changing your nickname
4. **Confirm logs appear** in their respective channels

<Tip>
  **Success\!** If you see logs appearing, Wish Logger is working perfectly. You're all set\!

## Common Questions

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Why aren't my logs showing up?">
    **Check these common issues:**

    - Wish Logger has permissions to send messages in your log channels
    - You've assigned channels in the dashboard for each log type
    - The events you're testing are actually being logged (some events are not possible to log due to discord limitations)
    - Try the `/ping` command to verify the bot is responding
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="What happens if I kick the bot and re-add it?">
    You'll need to reconfigure your log channels in the dashboard. The bot doesn't remember previous settings after being removed from a server.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Does it work with other bots like MEE6, Dyno, Carl-bot?">
    **Yes\!** Wish Logger works alongside other bots without conflicts. It focuses purely on logging and won't interfere with your existing moderation or utility bots as long as you disable the "Ignore Bots" settings in the dashboard
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Does the bot store my messages permanently?">
    Wish stores message data for **28 days** using the following process: Discord, after a certain time, only sends the message ID, not the content, attachments, or other information. We save the message data during this time so we can log it later.

    However, due to the "high" volume of logs (about **500** messages **per day**), we have to set some limits. The formula below calculates the likelihood of saving a message to the database:

    messageCacheLimit = 20000 · (1 / (1 \+ (x/(1-x))²)) \+ 200

    ---

    x = memberCount / 500000

    Where x is the member count of your server divided by 500,000.

    If a message isn't logged within Discord's timeframe, it won't appear in the logs. However, if the message is logged after this timeout, the deletion event will still be posted with the correct data. However, **servers that are using Premium** have **different behavior.** Premium servers are **exempt from message caching limits and have guaranteed message logging for all events.**

    Please note that there is **one exception**: messages will only be logged if the server has more than **150 members** (<u>excluding bots</u>).
