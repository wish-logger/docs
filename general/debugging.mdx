## Sample Debug Output

```json
{
  "1309879753548894348": {
    "server_name": "",
    "server_config": {},
    "ignore": {
      "channels": [],
      "messages": [],
      "targets": [],
      "executors": [],
      "roles": [],
      "categories": []
    },
    "additional_server_config": {
      "Defaults": {
        "DoIgnoreBots": true,
        "SendAttachmentsAsSpoilers": true
      },
      "Language": {
        "language": "en_us"
      }
    },
    "user_info": {
      "id": "",
      "username": "",
      "premium": true
    },
    "permissions": {
      "kickMembers": true,
      "banMembers": true,
      "administrator": true,
      "manageChannels": true,
      "manageGuild": true,
      "viewAuditLog": true,
      "sendMessages": true,
      "manageMessages": true,
      "embedLinks": true,
      "attachFiles": true,
      "readMessageHistory": true,
      "manageWebhooks": true
    },
    "custom_buttons": {}
      },
    }
  }
}
```

<Warning>
  The `custom_buttons` field only appears if the server has **customized** their button configuration. If not, this field will be **empty**.
</Warning>

## Default Button Configuration

If no custom configuration exists, Wish Logger uses these defaults:

```json
{
  "Defaults": {
    "Ban": { "Button": { "Label": "Ban", "Style": 2, ... } },
    "Kick": { "Button": { "Label": "Kick", "Style": 2, ... } },
    "SupportServer": { "Button": { "Label": "Support Server", "Style": 5, ... }
    "Customise": { "Button": { "Label": "Customise", "Style": 5, ... } },
    "EditReason": { "Button": { "Label": "Edit Reason", "Style": 2, ... } },
    "UserID": { "Button": { "Label": "User ID", "Style": 2, ... } },
    "Mute": { "Button": { "Label": "Mute", "Style": 2, ... } },
    "Revoke": { "Button": { "Label": "Revoke", "Style": 2, ... } }
  }
}
```

<Tip>
  When `custom_buttons` exists, it means the server has overridden the default settings.
</Tip>

## Reporting a Bug

If you’ve followed all steps, but something still isn’t working:

- First, check if your logging channels are assigned and the bot has permissions.
- Then test with /ping and common events (e.g., message delete, voice join).
- You can also go to https://wishlogger.xyz/support and see if there's an anwser for your question

### If everything looks right and logs still don’t show up…

If you're sure it's not caused by your setup, [**join our Support Server**](https://discord.com/invite/FRY3NfzgFJ) and report the bug. Please include:

- What isn't working
- Screenshot or exact command
- Whether it happens every time or randomly

<Tip>
  Use `/debug share:true` — this attaches a debug file specific to your server (attached in your report) that lets us instantly spot any configuration or internal issues.
</Tip>

<Info>
  Debug output is safe to share. It does **not include messages or personal content** — only server-level settings and logs metadata.
</Info>
