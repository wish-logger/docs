Although commands aren't a core focus of Wish, a small set of them is available to help with basic server management.

Most of Wish’s commands reply with temporary (ephemeral) messages that are only visible to the user who ran them. By default, access to these commands is limited.

<Note>
  If you’d like to turn off Wish's commands entirely, go to `Server Settings` → `Integrations` → `Wish Logger`, and remove command access for `@everyone` role.
