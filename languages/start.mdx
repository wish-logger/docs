## **Start Translating**

Currently, Wish uses GitHub to manage all of its language files. If you want to help translate Wish into your language, here's how to begin.

## **How to Contribute**

<Steps>
  <Step title="Open the Wish language repository" stepNumber={1}>
    Click [here](https://github.com/wish-logger/languages) to access the GitHub repository where all language files are stored.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Download the English, US language pack">
    Every new translation should begin with the `English, US` [pack](https://github.com/wish-logger/languages/tree/main/languages/en_us).

    Make sure that you have the following folders:

    - `base`
    - `generic`
    - `slash`

    Inside these folders, you’ll find JSON files to translate. Here's an example from `/base/party.json`:

    ```json
    "StickerAddedTitle": "{emoji} Sticker Added",
    "StickerAdded": "`{sticker}` was added by {user}",
    "StickerRemovedTitle": "{emoji} Sticker Removed",
    "StickerRemoved": "`{sticker}` was removed by {user}",
    ```

    You should **only** translate the text **after the colon** (`:`). Do **not** edit the keys (e.g. `"StickerAddedTitle"`) or any placeholder in curly brackets like `{user}`, `{emoji}`, or `{sticker}`. 

    Your translated folder should be named using your language code. Here's a [list of all the codes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_ISO_639_language_codes) — for example, if you're translating Wish to **Czech**, your folder should be named `cs`.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Submit your translation">
    Once your translation is ready, you can either:

    - Create a pull request on GitHub
    - Or send the files directly to `_impulse.dev` on Discord

    Your translation will be added in the next major update.\
    Keep in mind that if the `English, US` pack is updated, you’ll need to update your translation accordingly.
  </Step>
  <Step title="You're done!">
    After your language is added to Wish, you’ll receive the Translator role in our Discord server (if you're there).

    Please don’t use AI or automated tools like Google Translate if you don’t understand the language — we trust our contributors to provide accurate translations.
