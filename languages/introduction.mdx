Wish supports multiple languages, and more are being added continuously.\
The language used by Wish is based on the server's selected language setting.

To change the language Wish uses, you can:

- run the `/language <language>` command
- or update it from the **Settings** tab on your serverâ€™s [**Dashboard**](https://wishlogger.xyz/dashboard).

All translations are community-powered. If you'd like to contribute or start a new translation, check out the [adding](/languages/adding) and [start](/languages/start) pages\!

Thanks to everyone who's helped translate Wish so far\!
