Wish handles and stores a significant amount of data, which naturally raises questions about privacy. This page outlines how Wish stores that data, what steps are taken to protect it, and how you remain in control of your information.

## How Data Is Stored?

### Files

**Wish** stores uploaded files such as **images**, **videos**, **audio clips**, and **documents** for up to **4 weeks**.

When a file is sent, Wish checks whether the message qualifies for storage in the **4-week logging database**.

- If Wish determines the message is **not eligible**, neither the message nor its attachments will be saved.
- If it **is eligible**, Wish will:
  - **Compress and encrypt** the attachments
  - Upload the media securely to **R2 storage**
  - Link the file to the original message in the database

If the message is **deleted within 4 weeks**, all associated attachments will be **immediately erased**.\
After the 4-week period, attachments are **automatically removed** from our services.

Additionally, Wish will mark the file as **expired**. 

In short, Wish will display `Couldn't fetch an image` instead of the original file.

### Messages

Messages logged by Wish are retained for **28 days**, after which they are **automatically removed** from the database.\
You can find more about this retention policy on the [**Data Behaviour**](/data/behaviour) page.

Shortly after being received, messages are transferred to long-term encrypted storage.\
Wish uses **AES-256** encryption, with keys that are generated dynamically based on the message's metadata — such as the message ID and channel ID. This ensures each message is uniquely protected.

### Other Data

Wish also logs other information such as:

- **Stickers** and **emojis**
- **Webhooks**
- **User info** like <u>server nicknames,</u> <u>join timestamps,</u> and <u>moderation history</u>

Like messages, this data is encrypted using **AES-256**.\
The encryption key is generated on-the-fly using relevant context — for example:

- The ID of the emoji/sticker
- The server where an event took place
- The moderator responsible for an action

This ensures every item is stored securely and uniquely, even if similar data is logged across different servers or events.
