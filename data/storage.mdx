Wish handles and stores a significant amount of data, which naturally raises questions about privacy. This page outlines how Wish stores that data, what steps are taken to protect it, and how you remain in control of your information.

## How Data Is Stored?

### Files

Wish does **not** store uploaded files like images, videos, audio clips, or documents.\
Instead, it only retains the **publicly accessible link** to these files, which are hosted on Discord's own CDN.

A typical file link will look like this:

https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/{channel_id}/{attachment_id}/{filename}

This URL includes:

- The `channel_id` where the file was posted
- The `attachment_id` of the file
- The file's name at the end

Anyone with this link can access the file, even outside of Discord.

### Messages

Messages logged by Wish are retained for **28 days**, after which they are **automatically removed** from the database.\
You can find more about this retention policy on the [**Data Behaviour**](/data/behaviour) page.

Shortly after being received, messages are transferred to long-term encrypted storage.\
Wish uses **AES-256** encryption, with keys that are generated dynamically based on the message's metadata — such as the message ID and channel ID. This ensures each message is uniquely protected.

### Other Data

Wish also logs other information such as:

- **Stickers** and **emojis**
- **Webhooks**
- **User info** like <u>server nicknames,</u> <u>join timestamps,</u> and <u>moderation history</u>

Like messages, this data is encrypted using **AES-256**.\
The encryption key is generated on-the-fly using relevant context — for example:

- The ID of the emoji/sticker
- The server where an event took place
- The moderator responsible for an action

This ensures every item is stored securely and uniquely, even if similar data is logged across different servers or events.
