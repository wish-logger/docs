Wish processes over 1,000 messages and more than 200 files **every single day**, across 42 servers with a combined user base of over 4,000 people.

Given the sheer volume of data, Wish uses different storage methods and durations depending on the type and relevance of the data.

Storing all data forever isn’t practical or necessary — so Wish makes intentional decisions about **what** is stored, and **for how long**.
