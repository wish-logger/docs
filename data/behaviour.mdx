Wish collects a large amount of data, but none of it is stored forever.

\
This page explains how Wish determines what data is kept. As mentioned on the [**Storage**](/data/storage) page, messages are stored shortly after they are sent in your Discord server.

\
Below, you’ll learn what influences that decision.

## **Message Retention Logic**

### **For Non-Pro Servers**

Whether a message gets saved or not depends on two key conditions:

- A logging channel is configured
- The Message Author, Role, Message Content, Channel isn’t excluded via **Ignore Settings**

Even if both checks pass, saving a message isn't guaranteed.\
Wish uses a dynamic formula to determine message caching based on your server’s size.

                             messageCacheLimit = 20000 · (1 / (1 \+ (x / (1 - x))²)) \+ 200

                                         Where: x = (number of members) / 500000

This allows larger servers to have proportionally more message caching capacity, while keeping limits practical for smaller ones.

### **For Pro Servers**

Wish Pro simplifies the rules. Messages will be stored if **all** of the following apply:

- A logging channel is set up
- The Message Author, Role, Message Content, Channel isn’t excluded via **Ignore Settings**
- The server has **over 150 members** (bots excluded)

No formula is used here — once these checks are met, the message is always saved.
