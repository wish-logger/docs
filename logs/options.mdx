## Server-wide Options

These options apply globally to the bot’s behavior across your entire server.

### Language

<Note>
  "language": "en_us"
</Note>

Supported languages:

- English (en_us)
- Polish (pl)
- Russian (ru)

### Spoiler Attachments

<Note>
  "SendAttachmentsAsSpoilers": false
</Note>

All attachments will be automatically sent as **spoilered** in logs. This helps hide potentially sensitive content.

### Ignore Bots

<Note>
  "DoIgnoreBots": false
</Note>

All messages and actions by other **bots** will be ignored in logs. Helps reduce noise in moderation channels.

## Log Behavior Settings

These settings modify how the logger reacts to events. More options will appear as we expand the event system.

## Quark Integration

<Info>
  Quark Integration is not out yet.
</Info>

Wish Logger will soon support full integration with [Quark](https://quark.bot/) — punishment syncing.
