## **Introduction**

Wish generates a large number of logs on many servers. Often, looking back at a specific log or set of logs can be helpful. To make this easier, Wish is built to simplify the process of locating and reviewing past logs. This guide will walk you through the most effective ways to search your logs.

## **Searching Through Logs**

At this time, Wish does **not** support searching logs through its website.

All searches must be performed directly in Discord using [Discord’s built-in search tool](https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/115000468588-Using-Search).

### Understanding Wish's Log Layout

To effectively search with Discord’s search function, it’s important to understand how Wish structures its logs. Below is a breakdown of how to read the **"Reaction Removed"** log, which serves as an example for interpreting others.

| **Color**  | **Description**                                                                                             |
| :--------: | :---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------: |
| Red        | The title of the log (e.g. `Message Deleted`, `Message Edited`). In this case: `Reaction Removed`.          |
| Blue       | The main description of the log.                                                                            |
| Light Blue | The ID shown here is either a **User ID** or an **Object ID** (such as a Role, Emoji, Sticker, or Channel). |
| Orange     | The **Log ID** — a unique ID attached to each log entry.                                                    |

With this knowladge we can focus on actually using this knowladge.

## **Finding logs by user**

**it's pretty simple, you can grab the ID from the logs (Light Blue)**
