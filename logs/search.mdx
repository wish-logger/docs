## **Introduction**

For many servers, Wish sends _a lot_ of logs. However, it is often useful to refer back to a specific older log or group of logs. For this reason, Wish is designed to make the process of finding the logs you need as easy as possible.\
This page will guide you through the best ways to search through your logs.

## **Searching Through Logs**

Currently, Wish does **not** allow users to search through logs via the website.

All log searches must be done within Discord using [**Discord’s search feature**](https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/115000468588-Using-Search).

### Understanding Wish's Log Layout

To use discord's search with Wish, you have to understand what the log means, here's a detailed desciption of the "Reaction Removed" log

| **Color**  | **Description**                                                                                             |
| :--------: | :---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------: |
| Red        | The title of the log (e.g. `Message Deleted`, `Message Edited`). In this case: `Reaction Removed`.          |
| Blue       | The main description of the log.                                                                            |
| Light Blue | The ID shown here is either a **User ID** or an **Object ID** (such as a Role, Emoji, Sticker, or Channel). |
| Orange     | The **Log ID** — a unique ID attached to each log entry.                                                    |

With this knowladge we can focus on actually using this knowladge.
