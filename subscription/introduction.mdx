Currently, Wish does **not** offer any paid subscription plans.\
This means that all future premium features are available for free on the main bot — for now.

You might still come across references to things like inventories or **Wish Logger Pro** on the website or Discord server. Why?

\
Because we’re preparing for growth. In the future, Wish will introduce a paid tier to help support development and maintenance.

In the meantime, if you’d like to support the project, you can do so via our [Patreon](https://www.patreon.com/c/WishLogger)\!
